* Support different IPsec ports for each cluster
* Measuring and improving High Availability for gateway-labeled nodes
* Network Policy across clusters (Coastguard)
* Richer monitoring and alerting with Prometheus
* Support for finer-grained connectivity policies (<https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner/issues/533>)
* Support for more network plugins (OVN, Calico, others)
* Globalnet: annotating Global IPs per namespaces
